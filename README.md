# House-Price-Predictor
The House Price Predictor is a machine learning project designed to predict house prices based on various features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and more. This project includes a web application built using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the model and get price predictions in real-time.

#Features
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.

Machine Learning Model: A regression model is trained to predict house prices based on the input features.

Streamlit Web App: A user-friendly web interface where users can input house details and get instant price predictions.

Deployment: The model is deployed using Streamlit and can be accessed online.
